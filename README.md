Oh Hi.

This is the README document for my JS calculator project as part of my training work with _nology
If you're reading this, you either don't know what you've downloaded, or you're checking my work.
Either way, Here's a rundown.

This project is a single-page website, built in HTML with SCSS for styling and a Javascript program backend.
It is a simple calculator, based on the apple iPhone calculator.
Ideally this should be pleasant to view on all devices, but it's primarilly built for mobile.

The code should be publically accessable, if you want to look at it.
If you want to use it, just make sure to credit me.

Thanks!
-Isaac Dawson.
